## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Dependancies

This version of the game uses Font Awesome version 5.0.13 for icons and Press Start 2P font from Google Appis.  The browser must also support template literals and forEach (must be a modern browser).

## Instructions

Click two tiles. If they match, they will remain turned over. If they do not match, they will be flipped back over. When all tiles are matched, you will recieve a popup informing you of the time taken and your star rating. Click reset at any time to start over.
